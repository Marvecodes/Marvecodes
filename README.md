Hi there! 👋
I’m Marvellous — a Bioinformatics student with a background in Software Engineering. I’m passionate about combining biology, data, and code to solve complex problems in genomics and computational biology.

🌱 I’m currently learning and exploring new concepts in bioinformatics and computational biology.
💡 My interests span biological data analysis, computational genomics, and scientific software development.
🤝 I’m open to open-source collaborations, hackathons, internships, and entry-level roles where I can grow and contribute.
